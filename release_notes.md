# What's New

- **Renaming the Solution Pack:**
   - To enhance the overall experience, we've rebranded the *Sankey Visualizer* solution pack as the **Sankey** solution pack. This new name better reflects the capabilities and functionality this solution pack provides.

- **New Key Store Record: `widget_sankey_sample_data`:**
   - We've introduced a new Key Store Record named `widget_sankey_sample_data`. This record allows users to display Sankey charts using static JSON data, by default.
   - With this addition, users can easily visualize data flows and relationships in a more intuitive way, making it simpler to analyze complex processes.
